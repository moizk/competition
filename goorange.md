This is a website we are looking at for work. I know it's not a tech website but i thought some of it was cool.

I like the icons and the calendar. you can see the various options and how you can participate. 
I'm not sure how we feel about pictures but we could show pictures at various events like on the year in review showcase.
I also like the little calendar they have when you scroll down.
Pretty clean with splashes of orange :>
